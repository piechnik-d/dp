Raised on a farm in mid-Michigan, I found my passion for science in California doing ecological research.  Now residing in NY, I am an aspiring data scientist and a fiddle player.  

I recently left an academic position to change careers. I am seeking opportunities to apply my diverse skill set to sustainability and environmental problem-solving.
